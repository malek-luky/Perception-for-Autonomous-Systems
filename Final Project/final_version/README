To run the program, original images must be downloaded in following path format
"without_occlusion/left/*.png"
"without_occlusion/right/*.png"
"with_occlusion/left/*.png"
"with_occlusion/right/*.png"

Personal note: The images are in my DTU folder on OneDrive, they have more than 4GB, therefore are not uploaded to github
The sample images from image_processing folder might be used (lower fps, only 1 img per second)

Then just run main.py and enjoy! :)
